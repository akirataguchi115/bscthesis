This template package is designed so that each study programme X adds options in
HYthesisML.cls and creates its own HY_X_MSc_template.tex etc. that uses those options 
as parameters to \documentclass[]{}.

To add options in HYthesisML.cls, see examples shown between
% programme specific content starts
...
% programme specific content ends

HY-CS-MSc-template.tex works as an example on how to use the options for Master's thesis.
HY-CS-BSc-*.tex work as writing guidelines for CS Bachelor's theses.
