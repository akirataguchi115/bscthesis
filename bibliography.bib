  abstract  = {Recent researches have shown that large natural language processing (NLP) models are vulnerable to a kind of security threat called the Backdoor Attack. Backdoor attacked models can achieve good performance on clean test sets but perform badly on those input sentences injected with designed trigger words. In this work, we point out a potential problem of current backdoor attacking research: its evaluation ignores the stealthiness of backdoor attacks, and most of existing backdoor attacking methods are not stealthy either to system deployers or to system users. To address this issue, we first propose two additional stealthiness-based metrics to make the backdoor attacking evaluation more credible. We further propose a novel word-based backdoor attacking method based on negative data augmentation and modifying word embeddings, making an important step towards achieving stealthy backdoor attacking. Experiments on sentiment analysis and toxic detection tasks show that our method is much stealthier while maintaining pretty good attacking performance.

  abstract = {Natural language processing employs computational techniques for the purpose of learning, understanding, and producing human language content. Early computational approaches to language research focused on automating the analysis of the linguistic structure of language and developing basic technologies such as machine translation, speech recognition, and speech synthesis. Today’s researchers refine and make use of such tools in real-world applications, creating spoken dialogue systems and speech-to-speech translation engines, mining social media for information about health or finance, and identifying sentiment and emotion toward products and services. We describe successes and challenges in this rapidly advancing area.}

  abstract  = {Email spam filters based on machine learning techniques are widely deployed in today's organizations. As our society relies more on artificial intelligence (AI), the security of AI, especially the machine learning algorithms, becomes increasingly important and remains largely untested. Adversarial machine learning, on the other hand, attempts to defeat machine learning models through malicious input. In this paper, we experiment how adversarial scenario may impact the security of machine learning based mechanisms such as email spam filters. Using natural language processing (NLP) and Baysian model as an example, we developed and tested three invasive techniques, i.e., synonym replacement, ham word injection and spam word spacing. Our adversarial examples and results suggest that these techniques are effective in fooling the machine learning models. The study calls for more research on understanding and safeguarding machine learning based security mechanisms in the presence of adversaries.},

    abstract = "To combat adversarial spelling mistakes, we propose placing a word recognition model in front of the downstream classifier. Our word recognition models build upon the RNN semi-character architecture, introducing several new backoff strategies for handling rare and unseen words. Trained to recognize words corrupted by random adds, drops, swaps, and keyboard mistakes, our method achieves 32{\%} relative (and 3.3{\%} absolute) error reduction over the vanilla semi-character model. Notably, our pipeline confers robustness on the downstream classifier, outperforming both adversarial training and off-the-shelf spell checkers. Against a BERT model fine-tuned for sentiment analysis, a single adversarially-chosen character attack lowers accuracy from 90.3{\%} to 45.8{\%}. Our defense restores accuracy to 75{\%}. Surprisingly, better word recognition does not always entail greater robustness. Our analysis reveals that robustness also depends upon a quantity that we denote the sensitivity.",

	abstract = {The growth in the field of e-commerce and product availability over the Internet is the higher availability of the consumable items is making the customers seek for higher quality and comparative price points. The primary reason for this ambiguity is the lack of in hand experience for the customers before the purchase. The customers mostly tend to rely on the feedbacks of the other buyers. The feedbacks on the products are often made in thousands in numbers, and it is difficult for the potential buyers to decide by looking into these feedbacks or reviews. Thus the demand of the modern research is to automate the process for extracting the true feedback matching their needs based on usage or price or location constraints. The feedback or the review system can be easily manipulated by the incorrect feedbacks. Hence it is important to reduce the influence of those feedbacks during extracting the overall sentiment of any product. Also, yet another challenge is that most of the feedbacks are not in formal English, thus making it difficult to extract the accurate feedback. This work proposes a novel-automated frame for extracting the deep sentiments from the reviews or the feedbacks on e-commerce websites. Another major outcome of this work is to detect the false reviews and making the sentiment true for any decision making. The research work generates a trustable sentiment extraction process to justify the need of true feedbacks for customer decision making.},
